1.	Scrum master
1.1.	Facilitator and obstacle clearer
1.2.	Not product owner
1.3.	Not a manger / performance assessor (but often unavoidably is the case)
2.	Retrospective is the most useful aspect
2.1.	Continuous improvement
2.2.	How is everyone feeling
2.3.	Recognition of wins! Otherwise feels like Sisyphus.
2.4.	Can be hard (but absolutely essential) to get an open and honest environment
2.5.	I think my team KPI dashboard was useful for many of these reasons
3.	Product owner
3.1.	Difficult to find - most useful people often the most time poor people
3.2.	Need this to be treated as a full time role, not in addition to existing duties
3.3.	If a proxy, must be given appropriate authority to act as a proxy
3.4.	Ideally you would work this into a SOW or contract or if internal a deal-breaker/stop work if Product Owner input falls below x hours per week
4.	Ideally entire team works in the same room
4.1.	Offshore does not work: needs development scoped exhaustedly - defeats the purpose of agile
5.	Ideally scrum planning should occur ~2 weeks before start of next scrum
5.1.	This is really hard
5.2.	Backlog refinement key to this
6.	Minimum viable products and releasing often are ideal
7.	Sprint review meeting should involve product owner and users
8.	JIRA good tool
8.1.	Useful for visibility for Scrum Master E.g.
8.1.1.	There are too many in progress tasks
8.1.2.	There is a lot of testing coming up
8.2.	Provides empirical data on trends and what has been achieved previously. This helps push back on the need to reprioritise to realistic goals
9.	Good structure and governance solves a lot of problems
9.1.	Helps compensate for shortcomings e.g. unavailable Product Owner requires a more flexible team that can deal with ambiguity
9.2.	Allows appropriate stakeholder management
